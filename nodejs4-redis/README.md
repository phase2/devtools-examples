# Example Node.js v4.x Development Environment

Example Node.js v4.x development environment with Redis using Phase2's DevTools VM.

## Setup

### 1. Start the Node.js container with:

  - `docker-compose up`
  - In the log output, you should see `npm` running to install any dependencies from the included package.json. Then the example script should run and print a bunch of things as it operates on the various redis data structures
